## Overview

This project involves the analysis of Formula 1 driver performance data spanning several decades. The dataset contains valuable information about Formula 1 drivers, including their race wins, podiums, pole positions, and other performance metrics.

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the historical performance of Formula 1 drivers, understand trends, and provide meaningful deductions. We also explore the impact of technological advancements, changes in race strategies, and the competitiveness of the sport on driver performance.

## Dataset

- Dataset Name: Formula 1 Driver Performance Data
- Source: [Provide Data Source or Link]
- Format: CSV

## Files
